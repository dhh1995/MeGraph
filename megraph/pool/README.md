This folder includes implementations of some pool operators.

The ```globalpool.py``` file contains implementations of the **SUM**, **MAX**, **MEAN**, and **ATTENTION** pooling methods for the readout layer.

The ```edgepool_dgl.py```, ```louvain_dgl.py```, and ```random_pool.py``` files contain implementations of pool operators using our **S-EdgePool**, **Louvain** method, and **Random** method (for ablation study), respectively.

The ```cluster.py``` file contains the implementation of the cluster operator in **S-EdgePool**.
